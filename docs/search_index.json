Given a data set, you want to be able to make any plot you wish, find plots which show something actionable and interesting, explore data by slicing and dicing it and finally present your results in statistically convincing manner, perhaps in colorful and visually appealing way. Questions which you will have to anticipate and you will have to answer are - How do you know that your findings are not random? - And fundamental of all questions: - So what? Even the most impressing looking results may come up randomly. And you will be asked this question along with the question what was your p-value and how did you compute it And even if you convince your audience that your results are not random, you will have to be ready to explain why should you audience care about the results you reported. In other words, is there any actionable value in your results? Or they are just simply interesting, good to know, but no one really needs to care much about them otherwise? Hopefully it is the former not the latter. In the following sections we will address these questions and go through the process of data exploration, validation, and presentation. We will start with making plots, follow with free style data exploration  which allows us to form the leads, that is hypotheses. Then we will follow with simple statistical tests which will allow us to validate these hypothesis and defend our findings against randomness claims. - We will learn how to calculate p-values and how to use them to defend our findings. We will use as few R commands as possible and reach our goal in shortest possible path. In fact we will demonstrate how using just 7 R commands we can perform quite sophisticated data exploration. 1.1 Setting Up R* How to download and install R studio? How to upload a data set?

This rectangle height is proportional to the value of the variable in the vector. Barplots are also used to graphically represent the distribution of a categorical variable, after converting the categorical vector into a table(i.e. frequency distribution table) In a bar plot, you can also give different colors to each bar. 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 2.1.3 Box Plot A boxplot shows the distribution of data in a dataset.

This is the subject of data exploration. In this section we will go though this process which we call free style data exploration. Free style, since we are not going to use any sophisticated libraries, in fact we will just use 7 commands of R. And with these 7 commands we will be able to do quite a bit, more than you would ever guess in fact. So, no statistics, no sophisticated R programs. Just feeling the data with four plots and three R instructions: subset(), table() and tapply() Instant gratification through data exploration! It is amazing how much you can do with the data knowing 7 commands. There is no need for months of classes in stats or boot camp in R. You can learn one command a day, or an hour. And be ready to show off your skills and impress with such small arsenal of tools at your disposal. 2.2.0.1 Professor Moody Puzzle Here is professor Moodys puzzle which is the opening data puzzle in my Rutgers data 101 class, every year since 2015. And every year the data is generated according to different pattern. - Professor Moody has been teaching statistics 101 class for many years. His teaching evaluations went considerably south with the chief complaint: he DOES NOT seem to assign grades fairly. Students compared their scores among themselves and found quite a bit of discrepancies! But their complaints went nowhere since Professor promptly disappeared after posting the final grades and scores. - A new brave TA, managed to get hold of the carefully maintained grading table (spanning multiple years) of professor Moody by .messing a bit with Moody&#39;s computer.well, let&#39;s not explain the details because he would get in trouble. What he found out was a remarkably structured account of how professor Moody assigns his grades. - Looks like Professor Moody is in fact very alert in class. He is aware of what students do, detecting texting during class and remembering exactly who asked many questions in class. He also keeps the mysterious &quot;participation index&quot; which is a numerical score from 0 to 1. This is probably related to questions asked and answered by students as well as their general attentiveness in class. Remarkable but a little creepy, isn&#39;t it? - What is the best advice the new TA, can give future students how to get a good grade in Professor Moody&#39;s class? What factors influence the grade besides the score? Back your recommendation up with plots and evidence from the attached data. The Moody data set is defined here by the following attributes Moody[score, grade, participation, questions, texting] Score and grade are self explanatory. Participation is supposedly measuring students participation in class. One can only guess that this may be fraction of classes that student was present during the semester, but who knows it may be a fraction of minutes s/he was paying attention? Professor Moody is a mysterious and eccentric figure and we do not really know how he calculates participation, nor what kind of electronic surveillance tools he is using in his class. Attribute questions has several values always, frequently, sometimes and never. In our data set there are students who are are always texting and who never ask any questions. Oh, yes, and are almost never have any participation! Guess what grade are they getting? F, you probably guess. Not necessarily. By the way, our Professor Moodys scheme differs from year to year we usually use different behavioral attributes about students, like sitting in the first row, backrow student etc. Grading rules supposedly depend on Professor Moodys mood in a given semester. Our data set is synthetic and every year we generate it following new patterns embedded different moods of Professor Moody for that specific year. The job of students is to find these patterns. This is a good illustration of what data exploration is and can achieve. It is just an example, but one can of course easily see that, things we discuss here, applies to any data sets. Data exploration can be viewed as an indefinite loop: REPEAT{ Plot,one or many plots. Transform Data. } UNTIL GRATIFICATION In other words we keep plotting data for different slices of data and depending on the results we slice and plot and slice and plot until we are satisfied. Put yourself in the position of a student in Moodys class. - What does s/he want to know? - What should I do in order to pass his class. - Aside from getting the best score possible? - Ask many questions? - Do not text? - Do not doze off? - May be it is better not to come to class, when one is sleepy. What is the bigger risk? - How can we find the leads  helping us to discover the grading method of Professor Moody? What is the approach? First you need kick the tires, make some plots, feel the data and perhaps rule out the obvious. In case of Professor Moody data it may mean the following: - Test if straightforward mapping of scores into grades work in Professor Moodys class. Admittedly it is a long shot. We expect more from professor Moody than just merely following the scoring intervals with A above, say 85, B between 70 and 85 etc. But we need to establish that it is not the case quickly. Since it would be embarrassing to miss the obvious and simplest recommendation. Just score as high as you can. Does not matter what else you do. You may never ask any questions, always text in class or simplynever even show up. All it matters is score! There is just one plot which can quickly establish whether this simple rule works. And it is boxplot. 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 As we see in the plot, there are significant overlaps between successive grades. This disproves that there is a function between score and grade. At least it is not always a function. If your score falls in certain areas you may get either one of two grades (A or B, B or C, C or D, D or F). Here is how we can check which factors may impact the grade. One way of doing this analysis is to make barplots for all possible slices of Moody data frame by a given categorical variable For example,we want to know if asking questions matters for the grade? This can be validated by comparing barplots of grade distribution for different values of attribute questions. The following slices represent subsets of the Moody data frame for each of the values of the attribute questions The command \\(\\color{violet}{\\text{table}}\\) (one of the 7 commands) will provide us grade distribution for each of these slices. And the barplot, will visualize this table. Lets look at the example of the above process for students who always ask question. 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 We can also run several mosaic plots of GRADE vs one of the behavioral attributes to see if they matter in any way for the grade. In the following command we can combine attribute grade with anyone of the behavioral attributes 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 This can be concluded by comparing different columns and rows of the mosaic table. If grade distribution is similar for different values of behavioural attributes, this would indicate that these attributes do not matter in the establishing the grade. On the other hand we may catch professor Moody and find out that for some value of some attribute, grade distribution is significantly affected. This was the case several years ago when students sitting in the first row, got a grade bump up, even if they get similar scores to students sitting in the back row. We can see that asking many questions (frequently and always) really maters for the grade, there is more As and more Bs for these slices than in general. But this may have nothing to do with Professor Moody rewarding students with the bonus for asking questions. It may be simply the case that such students are more involved and study harder (or are more interested in the topic) and simply get higher scores. We need to dig deeper and see which of the two is the case. Moodys just gives his personal bonus to students who ask a lot of questions or no such bonus is given  such students simply score higher. We can accomplish this using again one of the seven R commands  the tapply. ## always never rarely ## 51.08277 56.32474 53.69217 will return average score for each of the values of the attribute moody$questions. If this values are more or less uniform than it will informally (not statistically yet, for this we have to wait for the next sections) show that questions matter in professor moody grading method and are not just correlated with students score.

Does asking questions often imply higher score? We can repeat this process for all attributes in our data set and all values. Yes, it is tedious! But mechanical. If there were a lot of values it would be a problem for sure, but we only have 4 values per attribute, all in all we have to 4 sets of 4 plots. They lead us to conclusion that the only other attributes which matters is when students always doze off, here the distributions of lower grades C, D and F is higher. And again we check if this is simply because scores for such students are lower 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 shows that mean scores are the same across different values of the texting attribute. Therefore it seems that the behavioural attributes: questions and texting do not seem to have an impact on the grade. Lets examine participation attribute. We define intervals of score as clear, if there is only one grade associated with scores from such interval. The remaining intervals are defined as grey - scores where grade can be either A or B, B or C, C or D and D or F respectively. Then we can examine how participation influences grades in these grey areas of score. Our hypothesis is that higher participation would probably offer better odds for higher grade. We can run the following command for different values of q. Lets check how the grade distribution changes for different values of q from the lower values of q to higher values of q. Run the following command for different values of q eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIG1vb2R5PC1yZWFkLmNzdihcIi4uL2ZpbGVzL2RhdGFzZXQvbW9vZHkyMDIwYi5jc3ZcIikgI3N0YXRpYyBMb2FkXG5tb29keTwtcmVhZC5jc3YoXCJodHRwczovL3Jhdy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vZGVlcGxva2hhbmRlL2RhdGExMDFkZW1vYm9vay9tYWluL2ZpbGVzL2RhdGFzZXQvbW9vZHkyMDIwYi5jc3ZcIikgI3dlYiBsb2FkXG5cbiNTaW1wbGUgUiBjb21tYW5kcyB0byBnZXQgaW50ZXJ2YWwgZm9yIGVhY2ggZ3JhZGUuXG5Mb3dlc3RBPC1taW4obW9vZHlbbW9vZHkkZ3JhZGU9PSdBJywgXSRzY29yZSlcbkhpZ2hlc3RCPC1tYXgobW9vZHlbbW9vZHkkZ3JhZGU9PSdCJywgXSRzY29yZSkgXG4jVGhpcyBnaXZlcyB1cyBpbnRlcnZhbCA8SGlnaGVzdEIsIExvd2VzdEE+XG5wcmludChMb3dlc3RBLEhpZ2hlc3RCKVxuXG5xPTAuNVxudGFibGUobW9vZHlbbW9vZHkkc2NvcmU+TG93ZXN0QSAmIG1vb2R5JHNjb3JlPEhpZ2hlc3RCJiBtb29keSRwYXJ0aWNpcGF0aW9uID4gcSxdJGdyYWRlKVxuXG4jTm90ZSB0aGUgc2FtZSBwcm9jZXNzIGNhbiBiZSByZXBlYXRlZCB3aXRoIG90aGVyIGFkamFjZW50IGdyYWRlcy4gRXg6IDxCLEM+IGV0Yy4ifQ== Please verify that for higher values of 0&lt;q&lt;1, the table operation show higher percentages of better grades. We come to conclusion that participation matter in grey area of score, in having higher chance for better grade, if participation is higher. Thus, just in case (since no one can predict if they will end up in border line score) it is better to earn high participation index  by (probably) coming to class more often and participating in discussions, and answering professor Moodys questions. Now we can reveal how data was generated? What was the real rule embedded in the data. Now it is time to reveal how we generated our data? We have indeed defined border areas in score value. In this border areas of score, participation plays a role. Student whoses score falls into the grey area may get one of two grades, A or B, B or C, C or D and D or F, depending on the score.For example score of 72 may result in A or B. It is more likely to be A if students participation is high (higher the better the odds of getting A). If students participation is low, it is much more likely to result in lower grade, for the score of 72, it would be B. Relationship between participation, score and grade In the process of slicing, dicing and plotting the data we would also discover other interesting relationships still using just 7 commands. Does higher participation mean higher score, in general? Meaning that such students just know more and perform better in tests and assignments. We can run scatter plot eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIG1vb2R5PC1yZWFkLmNzdihcIi4uL2ZpbGVzL2RhdGFzZXQvbW9vZHkyMDIwYi5jc3ZcIikgI3N0YXRpYyBMb2FkXG5tb29keTwtcmVhZC5jc3YoXCJodHRwczovL3Jhdy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vZGVlcGxva2hhbmRlL2RhdGExMDFkZW1vYm9vay9tYWluL2ZpbGVzL2RhdGFzZXQvbW9vZHkyMDIwYi5jc3ZcIikgI3dlYiBsb2FkXG5wbG90KG1vb2R5JHBhcnRpY2lwYXRpb24sIG1vb2R5JHNjb3JlKSJ9 Perhaps professor Moody used some threshold of participation to decide between A and B, we can define subset of moody frame 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 To see if M is perhaps higher than N? , if it is perhaps a threshold L, between M&lt;L&lt;N was used to decide between the grades of A and B.

If the one for A had higher median this would be an indication that participation mattered there. One of the most important questions in data science addresses difference between correlation and causation. What is the relationship of participation and score? One probably would not expect higher participation translating directly into higher score. But the following scatter plot seems to indicate (rather unexpectedly) that the higher the participation the lower the score! This seems very unintuitive. This is more of a consequence how we generated our data. For clear intervals, with score clearly mapping into single grade, we make participation low- reflecting the intended grading method which would ignore participation in case students score is clear. We can change values of parameters q and s and examine in more detail the relationships between scores and participation. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIG1vb2R5PC1yZWFkLmNzdihcIi4uL2ZpbGVzL2RhdGFzZXQvbW9vZHkyMDIwYi5jc3ZcIikgI3N0YXRpYyBMb2FkXG5tb29keTwtcmVhZC5jc3YoXCJodHRwczovL3Jhdy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vZGVlcGxva2hhbmRlL2RhdGExMDFkZW1vYm9vay9tYWluL2ZpbGVzL2RhdGFzZXQvbW9vZHkyMDIwYi5jc3ZcIikgI3dlYiBsb2FkXG5xPC0wLjFcbnM8LTcwXG5tZWFuKG1vb2R5W21vb2R5JHBhcnRpY2lwYXRpb24gPHEsXSRzY29yZSlcbm1lYW4obW9vZHlbbW9vZHkkc2NvcmUgPHMsXSRwYXJ0aWNpcGF0aW9uKSJ9 Exploring Behaviors of Students in professor Moodys class. One may even drop the grade entirely from the picture and simply inquire about behavioral characteristics of Professor Moodys students. We already know what is the distribution of each type of behavior eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIG1vb2R5PC1yZWFkLmNzdihcIi4uL2ZpbGVzL2RhdGFzZXQvbW9vZHkyMDIwYi5jc3ZcIikgI3N0YXRpYyBMb2FkXG5tb29keTwtcmVhZC5jc3YoXCJodHRwczovL3Jhdy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vZGVlcGxva2hhbmRlL2RhdGExMDFkZW1vYm9vay9tYWluL2ZpbGVzL2RhdGFzZXQvbW9vZHkyMDIwYi5jc3ZcIikgI3dlYiBsb2FkXG50YWJsZShtb29keSRxdWVzdGlvbnMpO1xudGFibGUobW9vZHkkdGV4dGluZykifQ== But lets ask for associations between behaviours Do students who ask a lot of questions also spend little time texting? Do students who participate more, generally texting less? These questions have nothing to do with students performance. But can all be answered using simple R.7 commands. It very much depend what is general thrust and motivation of the data analysis. Same data may serve different purposes. We started with predicting what behaviors help getting higher grade in professor Moodys class. But we can imagine a different study  which is addressing student behavior in professor Moodys class. Yet another study could address the impact of behavioral attributes on students scores (not grades). All these analysis can be done using or free style exploration and R.7. What we discover, and lets be very clear about it is not yet guaranteed to be statistically valid. For this we need statistical evaluation, The p-values, the z-tests etc. Later we will also find statistical functions which can greatly help in data exploration. Free style exploration role is to generate leads known otherwise as conjectures or hypotheses. Here is the set of recommendations from former student who cracked that years professor Moodys puzzle (or did she?) Judging by plots and means calculated earlier, there are several factors, besides score, that affect students grades:  Sleeping in class increases grade  Texting in class decreases grades a little  Being active(participating) in class all the time significantly increases the grade, BUT:  Being active(participating) in class just occasionally decreases the grade even more, than not participating at all.  Being active only occasionally significantly decreases the grades.  Texting does not significantly affect grades . So for students in order to succeed in professor Moodys class, my advice will be(besides getting high score):  VERY IMPORTANT: Participate all the time., or do not participate at all!!!  Sleep in class(especially if you do not participate anyway)  While texting might bring down your grade a little bit, the difference is very small 2.3 Data Frames &amp; New Column. Now we have to introduce the core data structure of R  the data frame and show we can expand it with extra attributes. Defining new attributes can very often be critical in data exploration and help to find patterns and relationships which otherwise would not be visible. For example, may be participation matters but only to Pass/Fail grades? In other words students who Pass (A or B or C) always have participation above a certain threshold? Perhaps students who always text never pass the class? And students who always ask questions never fail? Such rules can only be discovered if we define a new Pass/Fail attribute, additional to grade attribute. Similarly intervals of participation or score may discover important relationships which would not emerge with just numerical values of such attributes. May be High scores correlate with High participation? To establish it one would have first to define categorical attributes with named intervals of their numerical counterparts. 2.3.1 Create Column Lets put a column I have created using age to partition it into 3 category. Ill tell you how to partition more in upcoming sections. For now suppose I am given a new column \" colage \" with same number of rows as that of the data.frame. 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 eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjV2hhdCBoYXBwZW5zIHdoZW4geW91IGhhdmUgY29sdW1uIHNpemUgbWlzbWF0Y2guXG5iYWRjb2wgPC0gYygxOjEwKVxubGVuZ3RoKGJhZGNvbClcblxubW9vZHkkYmFkY29sIDwtIGJhZGNvbCAjVGhyb3dzIENvbXBhdGliaWxpdHkgZXJyb3IuICJ9 "],["stateval.html", "Chapter 3 Simple Statistical Evaluation 3.1 *z-test 3.2 Permutation Test 3.3 *Multiple Hypothesis - Bonferroni Correction.", " Chapter 3 Simple Statistical Evaluation The biggest enemy of your findings is randomness. In order to convince your audience that you have found something you need to address the question how do you know your result is simply sheer luck, it is random? This is where you need statistics and simple hypothesis testing. 3.0.0.1 *Some Basics First: Mean \\[\\begin{equation} \\bar{X}=\\frac{\\sum{X}}{N} \\ \\text{where, X is set of numbers and N is size of set.} \\end{equation}\\] Standard Deviation 3.1 *z-test A z-test is any statistical test used in hypothesis testing with an underlying normal distribution. In other words, when the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis can be approximated by a normal distribution, z-test can be used. Outcome of the z-test is the z-score which is a numerical measure to test the mean of a distribution. z-score is measured in terms of standard deviation from mean. 3.2 Permutation Test Permutation test also know as Randomization Test, is a type of statistical significance test in which the distribution of the test statistic under null hypothesis is obtained by calculating all possible values of the test statistic under all possible rearrangements of observed data points. 3.2.1 Permutation Test One Step Permutation test in one step is the most direct way to see randomness close by. One step permutation function shows one single data shuffle. By shuffling the data one destroys associations which exist between values of the data frame. This make data frame random. You can execute the one step permutation multiple times. This will show how data frame varies and how does it affect the observed difference of means. Apply one step permutation function first, multiple times before you move to the proper Permutation test function. One of the parameters of the Permutation test function specifies the number of shuffles which will be preformed. This could be a very large number, 10,000 or even 100,000. The purpose of making so many random permutations is to test how often observed difference of means can arise in just random data. The more often this takes place, the more likely you observation is just random. To reject the null hypothesis you need to show that the observed difference of means will come very infrequently in permutation test. Less than 5% of the time, to be exact. 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 3.2.2 Permutation Function The permutation function is used to run multiple iteration of the one-step permutation studied above, to get a complete relational understanding between the components involved in any hypothesis.

See how changing the mean and sd in rnorm distributions affects the p-value! It is very revealing.. Think of Val1, and Val2 as traffic volumes in Holland and Lincoln tunnels respectively. The larger the difference between the means of rnorm() function the smaller the p-value - since it is less and less likely that observed difference of means would come frequently, due to random sfuffles of permutation function. Now keep the same means and change the variances. See how changing the variances in rnorm() will affect the p-value and try to explain the effect that standard deviations have on the p-value. 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 3.3 *Multiple Hypothesis - Bonferroni Correction.
