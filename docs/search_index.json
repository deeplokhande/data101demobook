Data 101 is an introductory course for beginners from any field of study, interested in the field of Data Science. This books pages are created using Rmarkdown from Rstudio (similar to jupyter notebook) and the book is compiled using bookdown package. Note: This book is undergoing constant updates following along with the course thought in Spring 2021. Topics under progress are marked with a \" * \". "],["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Setting Up R", " Chapter 1 Introduction The objective of this textbook is to provide you the shortest path to exploring your data, visualizing it, forming hypotheses and validating and defending them. Given a data set, you want to be able to make any plot you wish, find plots which show something actionable and interesting, explore data by slicing and dicing it and finally present your results in statistically convincing manner, perhaps in colorful and visually appealing way. Questions which you will have to anticipate and you will have to answer are - How do you know that your findings are not random? - And fundamental of all questions: - So what? Even the most impressing looking results may come up randomly. And you will be asked this question along with the question what was your p-value and how did you compute it And even if you convince your audience that your results are not random, you will have to be ready to explain why should you audience care about the results you reported. In other words, is there any actionable value in your results? Or they are just simply interesting, good to know, but no one really needs to care much about them otherwise? Hopefully it is the former not the latter. In the following sections we will address these questions and go through the process of data exploration, validation, and presentation. We will start with making plots, follow with free style data exploration  which allows us to form the leads, that is hypotheses. Then we will follow with simple statistical tests which will allow us to validate these hypothesis and defend our findings against randomness claims. - We will learn how to calculate p-values and how to use them to defend our findings. We will use as few R commands as possible and reach our goal in shortest possible path. In fact we will demonstrate how using just 7 R commands we can perform quite sophisticated data exploration. 1.1 Setting Up R Important Instructions Installation of R is required before installing RStudio R is a programming language, and, RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which provides you a platform to code in R.

How to upload a data set? To upload the dataset/file present in csv format the read.csv() and read.csv2() functions are frequently used The read.csv() and read.csv2() have different separator symbol: for the former this is a comma, whereas the latter uses a semicolon. Let us look at the example. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIFJlYWQgaW4gdGhlIGRhdGFcbmRmIDwtIHJlYWQuY3N2KFwiaHR0cHM6Ly9yYXcuZ2l0aHVidXNlcmNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2RlZXBsb2toYW5kZS9kYXRhMTAxZGVtb2Jvb2svbWFpbi9maWxlcy9kYXRhc2V0L21vb2R5MjAyMGIuY3N2XCIpXG5cbiMgUHJpbnQgb3V0IGBkZmBcbmhlYWQoZGYpIn0= "],["dataexp.html", "Chapter 2 Data Exploration 2.1 Plots 2.2 Free Style data exploration with just seven R commands \" R.7 \" 2.3 Data Frames &amp; New Column.", " Chapter 2 Data Exploration 2.1 Plots Table 2.1: Snippet of Moody Dataset score grade texting questions participation 26.89 F never never 0.41 71.57 B always rarely 0.00 90.11 A always never 0.27 31.52 D sometimes rarely 0.68 95.94 A always rarely 0.09 45.72 D always rarely 0.19 90.82 A always always 0.25 75.52 B sometimes never 0.28 52.31 C never never 0.67 39.57 D always always 0.40 2.1.1 Scatter Plot Scatter Plot are used to plot points on the Cartesian plane (X-Y Plane) Hence it is used when both the labels are numerical values.

This rectangle height is proportional to the value of the variable in the vector. Barplots are also used to graphically represent the distribution of a categorical variable, after converting the categorical vector into a table(i.e. frequency distribution table) In a bar plot, you can also give different colors to each bar. 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 2.1.3 Box Plot A boxplot shows the distribution of data in a dataset. A boxplot shows the following things: Minimum Maximum Median First quartile Third quartile Outliers You can create a single boxplot using just a vector or a multiple boxplot using a formula. When you write a formula, you should use the Tilde (~) operator. This column name on the left side of this operator goes on the y axis and the column name on the right side of this operator goes on the x axis. 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 2.1.4 Mosiac Plot Mosaic plot is a graphical method for visualizing data from two or more qualitative variables.

This is the subject of the process known as data exploration. We will begin with what we call, the free style data exploration. We call it free style, since we are not going to use any sophisticated libraries, but rather just seven basic of commands of R. We call this set of commands - R.7. And with these seven commands of R.7 we will be able to do quite a bit of data exploration. We will be able to slice and dice data any way we want to. No statistics yet, and no more sophisticated R programs.These will come later. For now, we are just feeling the data with four plots and three R instructions: subset(), table() and tapply() Through this section we will use our usual inital example, of synthetically generate data describing mysterious methods of grading used by an excentric Professor Moody. We have been using different versions of this data puzzle over the 6 years of teaching data 101. Data is different but narrative is always the same: 2.2.0.1 Professor Moody Puzzle Professor Moody has been teaching statistics 101 class for many years. His teaching evaluations went considerably south with the chief complaint: he DOES NOT seem to assign grades fairly. Students compared their scores among themselves and found quite a bit of discrepancies! But their complaints went nowhere since Professor promptly disappeared after posting the final grades and scores. A new brave TA, managed to get hold of the carefully maintained grading table (spanning multiple years) of professor Moody by .messing a bit with Moodys computer.well, lets not explain the details because he would get in trouble. What he found out was a remarkably structured account of how professor Moody assigns his grades. Looks like Professor Moody is in fact very alert in class. He is aware of what students do, detecting texting during class and remembering exactly who asked many questions in class. He also keeps the mysterious participation index which is a numerical score from 0 to 1. This is probably related to questions asked and answered by students as well as their general attentiveness in class. Remarkable but a little creepy, isnt it? What is the best advice the new TA, can give future students how to get a good grade in Professor Moodys class? What factors influence the grade besides the score? Back your recommendation up with plots and evidence from the attached data. The Moody data set is defined here by the following attributes Moody[score, grade, participation, questions, texting] Score and grade are self explanatory. Participation is supposedly measuring students participation in class. We do not know whether higher particpation would necessarilly be postive, since Professor Moodys mood changes from year to year and he may be annoyed by students who are too active and bother him too much. Who knows? We have to find out. Attribute questions has several values always, frequently, sometimes and never. So does the attribute texting. In our data set there are students who are are always texting and who never ask any questions. Oh, yes, and some students particpation index is almost zero. Guess what grade are they getting? F, you probably guess. Well, but abouth their score.It should matter probably. At least to some degree! Grading rules, which Professor Moody applies each year are different. The objective of our free style data exploration is to find some leads/hypothese which would help us direct students what they should do to get a good grade in his class. This is a good illustration of what data exploration is and can achieve. It is just an example, but one can of course easily see that, things we discuss here, applies to any data sets. Data exploration can be viewed as an indefinite loop: REPEAT{ Plot,one or many plots. Transform Data. } UNTIL GRATIFICATION Put yourself in the position of a student in Moodys class. What does s/he want to know? What should I do in order to pass his class aside from getting the best score possible? Ask many questions? Do not text? Come to class as often as you can? Presumably imporving particpation idex? What is the approach? First you need kick the tires, make some plots, feel the data and perhaps rule out the obvious. In case of Professor Moody data it may mean the following: - Test if straightforward mapping of scores into grades work in Professor Moodys class. Admittedly it is a long shot. We expect more from professor Moody than just merely following the scoring intervals with A above, say 85, B between 70 and 85 etc! But we need to establish that it is not the case quickly. Since it would be embarrassing to miss the obvious and simplest recommendation. Just score as high as you can. Otherwise no need to come to class, and in class you can text as much as you want to and ask no questions. Does not matter what else you do. You may never ask any questions, always text in class or simplynever even show up. All it matters is score! There is just one plot which can quickly establish whether this simple rule works. And it is the boxplot. 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 As illustrated by the boxplot, there are significant overlaps between successive grades. This disproves that there is a determininstic function between score and grade. At least it is not always a function. If your score falls in certain grey areas you may get either one of two grades (A or B, B or C, C or D, D or F). And we do not know what is this aditional decider in such case when score falls into this grey area. Here is how we can check which factors may impact the grade. One way of doing this analysis is to make barplots for all possible slices of Moody data frame by a given categorical variable For example,we want to know if asking questions matters for the grade? This can be validated by comparing barplots of grade distribution for different values of attribute questions.You can either do it by applying the mossaic plot which allows for two-dimesnional representation of data and allows to create multicolored table for grade x questions to eyeball if values of attribute questions matter for values of attribute grade. To dig deeper into the relationship of categorical variables questions and texting with grade we will use sequence of bar plots over subsets of the Moody data frame. Then we will follow with the mosaic plots. The following slices represent subsets of the Moody data frame for each of the values of the attribute questions The command \\(\\color{violet}{\\text{table}}\\) (one of the 7 commands) will provide us grade distribution for each of these slices. And the barplot, will visualize this table. Lets look at the example of the above process for students who always ask question. 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 We can also run two mosaic plots of GRADE vs questions or texting respectively - and be able to asses the same - do these attributes matter for the grade?

If grade distribution is similar for different values of behavioural attributes, this would indicate that these attributes do not matter in the establishing the grade. On the other hand we may catch professor Moody and find out that for some value of some attribute, grade distribution is significantly affected. This was the case several years ago when students sitting in the first row, got a grade bump up, even if they get similar scores to students sitting in the back row. In that case one of the extra attributes included the row where students were sitting during class. We can see that asking many questions (frequently and always) really matters for the grade, there is more As and more Bs for these slices than in general. But this may have nothing to do with Professor Moody rewarding students with the bonus for asking questions. It may be simply the case that such students are more involved and study harder (or are more interested in the topic) and simply get higher scores. We need to dig deeper and see which of the two is the case. Moodys just gives his personal bonus to students who ask a lot of questions or no such bonus is given  such students simply score higher. We can accomplish this using again one of the seven R commands  the tapply. ## always never rarely ## 51.08277 56.32474 53.69217 will return average score for each of the values of the attribute moody$questions. If this values are more or less uniform than it will informally (not statistically yet, for this we have to wait for the next sections) show that questions matter in professor moody grading method and are not just correlated with students score.

Same is true for the mean scores of questions attribute. Neither do these two attributes texing and questions seem to have impact on the grade. Therefore it seems that the behavioural attributes: questions and texting do not seem to have an impact on the grade. Lets examine participation attribute. This is the only culprit left - to explain different grades in the grey intervals of score. We define intervals of score as clear, if there is only one grade associated with scores from such interval. The remaining intervals are defined as grey - scores where grade can be either A or B, B or C, C or D and D or F respectively. Then we can examine how participation influences grades in these grey areas of score. Our hypothesis is that higher participation would probably offer better odds for higher grade. We can run the following command for different values of q. Let q be a threshold of particpation which we want to test. May be if particpation is higher than q, higer grade (from the two possible grades in the grey area of score) is given, while if partcipation is lower than q, it works againts a student, who then gets lower grade? Lets check how the grade distribution changes for different values of q from the lower values of q to higher values of q. We can just change q directly in the code below, and see results immediately. Run the following command for different values of q. We will only show it for the grey interval between A and B. The same process can be repeated for othe grey areas between B and C, C and D and D and F. In fact one can modify the code below by just replacing grade A and B with B and C respetively as well as replacing the variables LowestA with Lowest B and Highest B with Highest C respectively. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIG1vb2R5PC1yZWFkLmNzdihcIi4uL2ZpbGVzL2RhdGFzZXQvbW9vZHkyMDIwYi5jc3ZcIikgI3N0YXRpYyBMb2FkXG5tb29keTwtcmVhZC5jc3YoXCJodHRwczovL3Jhdy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vZGVlcGxva2hhbmRlL2RhdGExMDFkZW1vYm9vay9tYWluL2ZpbGVzL2RhdGFzZXQvbW9vZHkyMDIwYi5jc3ZcIikgI3dlYiBsb2FkXG5cbiNTaW1wbGUgUiBjb21tYW5kcyB0byBnZXQgaW50ZXJ2YWwgZm9yIGVhY2ggZ3JhZGUuXG5Mb3dlc3RBPC1taW4obW9vZHlbbW9vZHkkZ3JhZGU9PSdBJywgXSRzY29yZSlcbkhpZ2hlc3RCPC1tYXgobW9vZHlbbW9vZHkkZ3JhZGU9PSdCJywgXSRzY29yZSkgXG4jVGhpcyBnaXZlcyB1cyBpbnRlcnZhbCA8SGlnaGVzdEIsIExvd2VzdEE+XG5wcmludChjKExvd2VzdEEsSGlnaGVzdEIpKVxuXG5xPTAuNSAjIFBsZWFzZSBFZGl0IHRoaXMgXCIgcSBcIiB2YWx1ZSBhbmQgc2VlIHRoZSBjaGFuZ2VzIGFzIG1lbnRpb25lZCBhYm92ZS5cbnRhYmxlKG1vb2R5W21vb2R5JHNjb3JlPkxvd2VzdEEgJiBtb29keSRzY29yZTxIaWdoZXN0QiYgbW9vZHkkcGFydGljaXBhdGlvbiA+IHEsXSRncmFkZSlcblxuI05vdGUgdGhlIHNhbWUgcHJvY2VzcyBjYW4gYmUgcmVwZWF0ZWQgd2l0aCBvdGhlciBhZGphY2VudCBncmFkZXMuIEV4OiA8QixDPiBldGMuIn0= Please verify that for higher values of 0&lt;q&lt;1, the table operation show higher percentages of better grades. Is there a critical value of q which clearly separates, say As from Bs? It seems to be q=0.6 - but it is not a clear cut deterministic. Rather, higher value of particpation threshold, q increases probability (frequency) of getting As. We come to conclusion that participation matter in grey area of score, in having higher chance for better grade, if participation is higher. Thus, just in case (since no one can predict if they will end up in border line score) it is better to earn high participation index  by (probably) coming to class more often and participating in discussions, and answering professor Moodys questions. Simply put come to as many classes as you can. But while in class, do not worry about texting or asking questions. These two attributes do not seem to matter. Now we can reveal how data was generated? What was the real rule embedded in the data. Now it is time to reveal how we generated our data? This what we embedded in our data generation method: particpation increases the chances of higher grade in the grey areas of score (border areas). We have indeed defined border areas in score value. In this border areas of score, participation plays a role. Student whoses score falls into the grey area may get one of two grades, A or B, B or C, C or D and D or F, depending on the score.For example score of 72 may result in A or B. It is more likely to be A if students participation is high (higher the better the odds of getting A). If students participation is low, it is much more likely to result in lower grade, for the score of 72, it would be B. Therefore we have discovered more or less the rule which guided generation of the Moodys data set and provided students with actionable intelligence how to increase chances of getting higher grade. Relationship between participation, score and grade In the process of slicing, dicing and plotting the data we would also discover other interesting relationships still using just 7 commands. Does higher participation mean higher score, in general? Meaning that coming to class is positively correlated with higher score? We can run scatter plot eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIG1vb2R5PC1yZWFkLmNzdihcIi4uL2ZpbGVzL2RhdGFzZXQvbW9vZHkyMDIwYi5jc3ZcIikgI3N0YXRpYyBMb2FkXG5tb29keTwtcmVhZC5jc3YoXCJodHRwczovL3Jhdy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vZGVlcGxva2hhbmRlL2RhdGExMDFkZW1vYm9vay9tYWluL2ZpbGVzL2RhdGFzZXQvbW9vZHkyMDIwYi5jc3ZcIikgI3dlYiBsb2FkXG5wbG90KG1vb2R5JHBhcnRpY2lwYXRpb24sIG1vb2R5JHNjb3JlKSJ9 To our suprise it looks like the higher the particpation, the lower the score! The distinct linear patterns in scatter graph seem to be sloping down with particpation. We are tempted to infer that partcipation is bad for score, that somehow Moodys lectures have negative impact on the score - hence do not carry pedagogical value. Such conclusion is typical confusion between correlation and causation. What is true in our simulated data set - that students had some prior background in the subject matter of Professo Moody just do not show up in class that often. They already know the material. Students who do show up are the ones who are not confident in their knowledge of the subject matter - in general weak As and below. Then of course lower grade students (Ds and Fs) just simply do not apply themselves that much - are not invested into the class and just show up in class even less. Thus, the explanation probably has more to do with the students attribute about the class than with the pedagogical value of Professor Moodys letures. We can change values of parameters q and s and examine in more detail the relationships between scores and participation. 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 Exploring Behaviors of Students in professor Moodys class. One may even drop the grade entirely from the picture and simply inquire about behavioral characteristics of Professor Moodys students. We already know what is the distribution of each type of behavior eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIG1vb2R5PC1yZWFkLmNzdihcIi4uL2ZpbGVzL2RhdGFzZXQvbW9vZHkyMDIwYi5jc3ZcIikgI3N0YXRpYyBMb2FkXG5tb29keTwtcmVhZC5jc3YoXCJodHRwczovL3Jhdy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vZGVlcGxva2hhbmRlL2RhdGExMDFkZW1vYm9vay9tYWluL2ZpbGVzL2RhdGFzZXQvbW9vZHkyMDIwYi5jc3ZcIikgI3dlYiBsb2FkXG50YWJsZShtb29keSRxdWVzdGlvbnMpO1xudGFibGUobW9vZHkkdGV4dGluZykifQ== But lets ask for associations between behaviours Do students who ask a lot of questions also spend little time texting? Do students who participate more, generally texting less? These questions have nothing to do with students performance. But can all be answered using simple R.7 commands. Same data may serve different purposes. We started with predicting what behaviors help getting higher grade in professor Moodys class. But we can imagine a different study  which is addressing student behavior in professor Moodys class. Yet another study could address the impact of behavioral attributes on students scores (not grades). All these analysis can be done using or free style exploration and R.7. What we discover, and lets be very clear about it is not yet guaranteed to be statistically valid. For this we need statistical evaluation, The p-values, the z-tests etc. Later we will also find statistical functions which can greatly help in data exploration. Free style exploration role is to generate leads known otherwise as conjectures or hypotheses. Our professor Moodys data puzzle has been traditional the first data puzzle we ask students to solve in data 101 class. Here are some examples of conlusions reached on different instances of professor Moodys data set in the past semesters. Notice that attributes of Moodys data set in past may have been different (like sleeping in class) Here is the set of recommendations from former student who cracked that years professor Moodys puzzle (or did she?) Judging by plots and means calculated earlier, there are several factors, besides score, that affect students grades:  Sleeping in class increases grade  Texting in class decreases grades a little  Being active(participating) in class all the time significantly increases the grade, BUT:  Being active(participating) in class just occasionally decreases the grade even more, than not participating at all.  Being active only occasionally significantly decreases the grades.  Texting does not significantly affect grades . So for students in order to succeed in professor Moodys class, my advice will be(besides getting high score):  VERY IMPORTANT: Participate all the time., or do not participate at all!!!  Sleep in class(especially if you do not participate anyway)  While texting might bring down your grade a little bit, the difference is very small 2.3 Data Frames &amp; New Column. Now we have to introduce the core data structure of R  the data frame and show we can expand it with extra attributes. Defining new attributes can very often be critical in data exploration and help to find patterns and relationships which otherwise would not be visible. For example, may be participation matters but only to Pass/Fail grades? In other words students who Pass (A or B or C) always have participation above a certain threshold? Perhaps students who always text never pass the class? And students who always ask questions never fail? Such rules can only be discovered if we define a new Pass/Fail attribute, additional to grade attribute. Similarly intervals of participation or score may discover important relationships which would not emerge with just numerical values of such attributes. May be High scores correlate with High participation? To establish it one would have first to define categorical attributes with named intervals of their numerical counterparts. 2.3.1 Create Column Lets put a column I have created using age to partition it into 3 category. Ill tell you how to partition more in upcoming sections. For now suppose I am given a new column \" colage \" with same number of rows as that of the data.frame. 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 eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiIjIG1vb2R5PC1yZWFkLmNzdihcIi4uL2ZpbGVzL2RhdGFzZXQvbW9vZHkyMDIwYi5jc3ZcIikgI3N0YXRpYyBMb2FkXG5tb29keTwtcmVhZC5jc3YoXCJodHRwczovL3Jhdy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vZGVlcGxva2hhbmRlL2RhdGExMDFkZW1vYm9vay9tYWluL2ZpbGVzL2RhdGFzZXQvbW9vZHkyMDIwYi5jc3ZcIikgI3dlYiBsb2FkXG5cbiNXaGF0IGhhcHBlbnMgd2hlbiB5b3UgaGF2ZSBjb2x1bW4gc2l6ZSBtaXNtYXRjaC5cbmJhZGNvbCA8LSBjKDE6MTApXG5sZW5ndGgoYmFkY29sKVxuXG5tb29keSRiYWRjb2wgPC0gYmFkY29sICNUaHJvd3MgQ29tcGF0aWJpbGl0eSBlcnJvci4gIn0= "],["stateval.html", "Chapter 3 Simple Statistical Evaluation 3.1 *z-test 3.2 Permutation Test 3.3 *Multiple Hypothesis - Bonferroni Correction.", " Chapter 3 Simple Statistical Evaluation The biggest enemy of your findings is randomness. In order to convince your audience that you have found something you need to address the question how do you know your result is simply sheer luck, it is random? This is where you need statistics and simple hypothesis testing. 3.0.0.1 *Some Basics First: Mean \\[\\begin{equation} \\bar{X}=\\frac{\\sum{X}}{N} \\ \\text{where, X is set of numbers and N is size of set.} \\end{equation}\\] Standard Deviation \\[\\begin{equation} \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum{(X - \\mu)^2}}{N}}\\\\ \\text{where, X is set of numbers, $\\mu$ is average of set of numbers, }\\\\ \\text{ N is size of the set, $\\sigma$ is standard deviation} \\end{equation}\\] 3.1 *z-test A z-test is any statistical test used in hypothesis testing with an underlying normal distribution. In other words, when the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis can be approximated by a normal distribution, z-test can be used. Outcome of the z-test is the z-score which is a numerical measure to test the mean of a distribution. z-score is measured in terms of standard deviation from mean. 3.2 Permutation Test Permutation test allows us to observe randomness directly, with naked eye, without the lenses of statistical tests such as z-tests etc. We sfuffle data randomly like a deck of cards. There may be many such shuffles - 10,000, 100,000 etc. The goal is always to see how often we can obtained the observed difference of means (since we are testing either one sided or two sided hypothesis), by purely random shuffles of our data. These permutations (sfuffles) destroy all relatinships which may pre-exist in our data. We are hoping to show that our observed diffence of means can be obtained very rarely in completely random fashion. Then we experimentally show that our result is unlikely to randomly occur under null hyoothesis. Then we can reject the null hypothesis. The less often our result appear in the histogram of permutation test results, the better the news for our alternative hypothesis. What is suprising to many newcomers, is that permutation test will give different p-values (not dramatically different, but still different) in each run of permutation test. This is the case because permutation test in random itself. It is not like z-test which will give the same result when run again for the same hypothesis and same data set. Also p-value computed by permutation test will be, in general, different than p-value computed by z-test. Not very different but different. Again, it is the case because permutation test provides only approximation of p-value. Great advantage of permutation test is that it is universal and robust. One can test different relationships betteen two variables than just difference of means. For example we can use permutation test to validate whether traffic in Lincoln tunnel is more than twice the traffic in Holland tunnel or even provide different weights for different days of the week. 3.2.1 Permutation Test One Step Permutation test in one step is the most direct way to see randomness close by. One step permutation function shows one single data shuffle. By shuffling the data one destroys associations which exist between values of the data frame. This make data frame random. You can execute the one step permutation multiple times. This will show how data frame varies and how does it affect the observed difference of means. Apply one step permutation function first, multiple times before you move to the proper Permutation test function. One of the parameters of the Permutation test function specifies the number of shuffles which will be preformed. This could be a very large number, 10,000 or even 100,000. The purpose of making so many random permutations is to test how often observed difference of means can arise in just random data. The more often this takes place, the more likely you observation is just random. To reject the null hypothesis you need to show that the observed difference of means will come very infrequently in permutation test. Less than 5% of the time, to be exact. 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 3.2.2 Permutation Function The permutation function is used to run multiple iteration of the one-step permutation studied above, to get a complete relational understanding between the components involved in any hypothesis.

See how changing the mean and sd in rnorm distributions affects the p-value! Again you can do it directly in the code and observe the results immediately. It is very revealing.. Think of Val1, and Val2 as traffic volumes in Holland and Lincoln tunnels respectively. The larger the difference between the means of rnorm() function the smaller the p-value - since it is less and less likely that observed difference of means would come frequently, due to random sfuffles of permutation function. Now keep the same means and change the variances. See how changing the variances in rnorm() will affect the p-value and try to explain the effect that standard deviations have on the p-value. In general, the higher the standar deviation, the more widely data is centered around the mean. Thus even for the same two means, and two different value of deviations, we can see larger value of deviation to lead to higher p-value. Since we are less certian of the role of the mean if standard deviation is higher. Therefore, the chance of randomly obtaining the observed result, is higher. eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJwcmVfZXhlcmNpc2VfY29kZSI6IlBlcm11dGF0aW9uIDwtIGZ1bmN0aW9uKGRmMSxjMSxjMixuLHcxLHcyKXtcbiAgZGYgPC0gYXMuZGF0YS5mcmFtZShkZjEpXG4gIERfbnVsbDwtYygpXG4gIFYxPC1kZlssYzFdXG4gIFYyPC1kZlssYzJdXG4gIHN1Yi52YWx1ZTEgPC0gZGZbZGZbLCBjMV0gPT0gdzEsIGMyXVxuICBzdWIudmFsdWUyIDwtIGRmW2RmWywgYzFdID09IHcyLCBjMl1cbiAgRCA8LSAgYWJzKG1lYW4oc3ViLnZhbHVlMiwgbmEucm09VFJVRSkgLSBtZWFuKHN1Yi52YWx1ZTEsIG5hLnJtPVRSVUUpKVxuICBtPWxlbmd0aChWMSlcbiAgbD1sZW5ndGgoVjFbVjE9PXcyXSlcbiAgZm9yKGpqIGluIDE6bil7XG4gICAgbnVsbCA8LSByZXAodzEsbGVuZ3RoKFYxKSlcbiAgICBudWxsW3NhbXBsZShtLGwpXSA8LSB3MlxuICAgIG5mIDwtIGRhdGEuZnJhbWUoS2V5PW51bGwsIFZhbHVlPVYyKVxuICAgIG5hbWVzKG5mKSA8LSBjKFwiS2V5XCIsXCJWYWx1ZVwiKVxuICAgIHcxX251bGwgPC0gbmZbbmYkS2V5ID09IHcxLDJdXG4gICAgdzJfbnVsbCA8LSBuZltuZiRLZXkgPT0gdzIsMl1cbiAgICBEX251bGwgPC0gYyhEX251bGwsbWVhbih3Ml9udWxsLCBuYS5ybT1UUlVFKSAtIG1lYW4odzFfbnVsbCwgbmEucm09VFJVRSkpXG4gIH1cbiAgbXloaXN0PC1oaXN0KERfbnVsbCwgcHJvYj1UUlVFKVxuICBtdWx0aXBsaWVyIDwtIG15aGlzdCRjb3VudHMgLyBteWhpc3QkZGVuc2l0eVxuICBteWRlbnNpdHkgPC0gZGVuc2l0eShEX251bGwsIGFkanVzdD0yKVxuICBteWRlbnNpdHkkeSA8LSBteWRlbnNpdHkkeSAqIG11bHRpcGxpZXJbMV1cbiAgcGxvdChteWhpc3QpXG4gIGxpbmVzKG15ZGVuc2l0eSwgY29sPSdibHVlJylcbiAgYWJsaW5lKHY9RCwgY29sPSdyZWQnKVxuICBNPC1tZWFuKERfbnVsbD5EKVxuICByZXR1cm4oTSlcbn0iLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJOLmggPC0gMTAgI051bWJlciBvZiB0dXBsZXMgZm9yIEhvbGxhbmQgVHVubmVsXG5OLmwgPC0gMTAgI051bWJlciBvZiB0dXBsZXMgZm9yIExpbmNvbG4gVHVubmVsXG5cbkNhdDE8LXJlcChcIkdyb3VwQVwiLE4uaCkgICMgZm9yIGV4YW1wbGUgR3JvdXBBIGNhbiBiZSBIb2xsYW5kIFR1bm5lbFxuQ2F0MjwtcmVwKFwiR3JvdXBCXCIsTi5sKSAgIyBmb3IgZXhhbXBsZSBHcm91cCBCIHdpbGwgYmUgTGluY29sbiBUdW5uZWxcblxuQ2F0MVxuQ2F0MlxuXG4jVGhlIHJlcCBjb21tYW5kIHdpbGwgcmVwZWF0LCB0aGUgdmFyaWFibGVzIHdpbGwgYmUgb2YgdHlwZSBjaGFyYWN0ZXIgYW5kIHdpbGwgY29udGFpbiAxMCB2YWx1ZXMgZWFjaC5cblxuQ2F0PC1jKENhdDEsQ2F0MikgIyBBIHZhcmlhYmxlIHdpdGggZmlyc3QgMTAgdmFsdWVzIEdyb3VwQSBhbmQgbmV4dCAxMCB2YWx1ZXMgR3JvdXBCXG5DYXRcblxuI1RyeSBjaGFuZ2luZyBtZWFuIGFuZCBzZCB2YWx1ZXMuIFdoZW4geW91IHJ1biB0aGlzIHlvdSB3aWxsIHNlZSB0aGF0IHRoZSBkaWZmZXJlbmNlIGlzIHNvbWV0aW1lcyBuZWdhdGl2ZSAjb3Igc29tZXRpbWVzIHBvc2l0aXZlLlxuXG5WYWwxPC1ybm9ybShOLmgsbWVhbj0yNSwgc2Q9MTApICNzYXksIHRyYWZmaWMgdm9sdW1lIGluIEhvbGxhbmQgVCBhcyBub3JtYWwgZGlzdHJpYnV0aW9uIHdpdGggbWVhbiBhbmQgc2RcblZhbDI8LXJub3JtKE4ubCxtZWFuPTMwLCBzZD0xMCkgI3NheSwgdHJhZmZpYyB2b2x1bWUgaW4gTGluY29sbiBUIGFzIG5vcm1hbCBkaXN0cmlidXRpb24gd2l0aCBtZWFuIGFuZCBzZFxuXG5WYWw8LWMoVmFsMSxWYWwyKSAjQSB2YXJpYWJsZSB3aXRoIDIwIHJvd3MsIHdpdGggZmlyc3QgMTAgcm93cyBjb250YWluaW5nIDEwIHJhbmRvbSBub3JtYWwgdmFsdWVzIG9mIFZhbDEgI2FuZCB0aGUgbmV4dCAxMCB2YWx1ZXMgb2YgVmFsMlxuXG5WYWxcblxuZDwtZGF0YS5mcmFtZShDYXQsVmFsKVxuXG5PYnNlcnZlZF9EaWZmZXJlbmNlPC1tZWFuKGRbZCRDYXQ9PSdHcm91cEEnLDJdKS1tZWFuKGRbZCRDYXQ9PSdHcm91cEInLDJdKVxuXG4jVGhpcyB3aWxsIGNhbGN1bGF0ZSB0aGUgbWVhbiBvZiB0aGUgc2Vjb25kIGNvbHVtbiAoaGF2aW5nIDEwIHJhbmRvbSB2YWx1ZXMgZm9yIGVhY2ggZ3JvdXApLCBhbmQgdGhlIG1lYW4gb2YgZ3JvdXBCIHZhbHVlcyBpcyBzdWJ0cmFjdGVkIGZyb20gdGhlIG1lYW4gb2YgZ3JvdXBBIHZhbHVlcywgd2hpY2ggd2lsbCBnaXZlIHlvdSB0aGUgdmFsdWUgb2YgdGhlIGRpZmZlcmVuY2Ugb2YgdGhlIG1lYW4uXG5PYnNlcnZlZF9EaWZmZXJlbmNlXG5cblxuUGVybXV0YXRpb24oZCwgXCJDYXRcIiwgXCJWYWxcIiwxMDAwMCwgXCJHcm91cEFcIiwgXCJHcm91cEJcIilcblxuI1RoZSBQZXJtdXRhdGlvbiBmdW5jdGlvbiByZXR1cm5zIHRoZSBhYnNvbHV0ZSB2YWx1ZSBvZiB0aGUgZGlmZmVyZW5jZS4gU28gdGhlIHJlZCBsaW5lIGlzIHRoZSBhYnNvbHV0ZSB2YWx1ZSBvZiB0aGUgb2JzZXJ2ZWQgZGlmZmVyZW5jZS4gWW91IHdpbGwgc2VlIGEgaGlzdG9ncmFtIGhhdmluZyBhIG5vcm1hbCBkaXN0cmlidXRpb24gd2l0aCBhIHJlZCBzaG93aW5nIHRoZSBvYnNlcnZlZCBkaWZmZXJlbmNlLiJ9 3.3 *Multiple Hypothesis - Bonferroni Correction.

The examples we use here will be helpful in revising few of the functions we studied and would give an baseline of function we would need in the future while programming in R. List of commands: c() data.frame() subset() table() tapply() cut() summary(), mean(),length(), max(),min(), sd(),nrow(), ncol() class() And also all the plot commands present in section 2.1 4.1 c() &amp; data.frame() &amp; class() c() The c() function is used for combining arguments. The default behavior of the c() method is to combine its arguments to form a vector. All arguments are coerced (forcibly converted) to a common type which is the type of the returned value. For example,the non-character values are coerced to character type if one of the elements is a character. the hierarchy followed is NULL &lt; raw &lt; logical &lt; integer &lt; double &lt; complex &lt; character &lt; list &lt; expression. dataframe() A data frame is a table or a two-dimensional array-like structure in which each column contains values of one variable and each row contains one set of values from each column. Following are the characteristics of a data frame. The column names should be non-empty. The row names should be unique. The data stored in a data frame can be of numeric, factor or character type. Each column should contain same number of data items. class() The class() function has multiple uses, but for here, it is used to check the type of object. 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 4.2 summary(), mean(),length(), max(),min(), sd(),nrow(), ncol(), dim() The functions in this section are very simple yet are always useful to get more information from data. summary() function computes summary statistics of data. mean() function is used to find the average of the data. sd() fucntion is used to find the standard deviation of the data. length() function is used to get or set the length of data. max() function is used to get the maximum valued element in the data. min() function is used to get the minimum valued element in the data. nrow() function is used to find the number/count of the rows present in data. ncol() function is used to find the number/count of the columns present in data. dim() function is used to find the dimensions of the data.

This is the only way to learn simple commands - and have them memorized so you can write code without having to check every single command. 4.7.1 Question eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJ3ZWF0aGVyID1kYXRhLmZyYW1lKERheT1jKCd3ZWVrZGF5JywgJ3dlZWtlbmQnKSwgQ29uZGl0aW9ucyA9Yygnc3VubnknLCdyYWlueScsJ2Nsb3VkeScsICdzbm93JywgJ3N0b3JtJywnaWNlJykpXG5kaW0od2VhdGhlcilcbiN3aGF0IHdvdWxkIFIgc2F5PyJ9 4.7.2 Question eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJ3ZWF0aGVyID1kYXRhLmZyYW1lKERheT1jKCd3ZWVrZGF5JywgJ3dlZWtlbmQnKSwgQ29uZGl0aW9ucyA9Yygnc3VubnknLCdyYWlueScsJ2Nsb3VkeScsICdzbm93JywgJ3N0b3JtJywnaWNlJykpXG53ZWF0aGVyJHRlbXBlcmF0dXJlID1jKDgwLCA3MCwgNjUsIDQwLCAzMCwyNSlcbndlYXRoZXJbd2VhdGhlciR0ZW1wZXJhdHVyZSA+IDQwLCBdXG5kaW0od2VhdGhlcilcbiN3aGF0IHdvdWxkIFIgc2F5PyJ9 4.7.3 Question eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJTQ09SRT1jKDMwLDE1LDY2KTtcbkdSQURFPWMoJ0MnLCAnRicsICdBJylcbk9OX1NNQVJUUEhPTkU9YygnYWx3YXlzJywgJ25ldmVyJywgJ3NvbWV0aW1lcycpXG5GSU5BTEVYQU09YygxMiw1LDIwKVxuTT1kYXRhLmZyYW1lKFNDT1JFLCBHUkFERSwgT05fU01BUlRQSE9ORSwgRklOQUxFWEFNKVxuc3Vic2V0KE0sIEdSQURFPT0nRicpXG4jd2hhdCB3b3VsZCBSIHNheT8ifQ== 4.7.4 Question eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJTQ09SRT1jKDMwLDE1LDY2KTtcbkdSQURFPWMoJ0MnLCAnRicsICdBJylcbk9OX1NNQVJUUEhPTkU9YygnYWx3YXlzJywgJ25ldmVyJywgJ3NvbWV0aW1lcycpXG5GSU5BTEVYQU09YygxMiw1LDIwKVxuTT1kYXRhLmZyYW1lKFNDT1JFLCBHUkFERSwgT05fU01BUlRQSE9ORSwgRklOQUxFWEFNKVxuTVtGSU5BTEVYQU0gPiA1LF1cbiN3aGF0IHdvdWxkIFIgc2F5PyJ9 4.7.5 Question eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJTQ09SRT1jKDMwLDE1LDY2KVxuR1JBREU9YygnQycsICdGJywgJ0EnKVxuT05fU01BUlRQSE9ORT1jKCdhbHdheXMnLCAnbmV2ZXInLCAnc29tZXRpbWVzJylcbkZJTkFMRVhBTT1jKDEyLDUsMjApXG5NPWRhdGEuZnJhbWUoU0NPUkUsIEdSQURFLCBPTl9TTUFSVFBIT05FLCBGSU5BTEVYQU0pXG5NJFFVRVNUSU9OUz0nbm9uZSdcbk1bLDVdXG4jd2hhdCB3b3VsZCBSIHNheT8ifQ== 4.7.6 Question eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJTQ09SRT1jKDMwLDE1LDY2KVxuR1JBREU9YygnQycsICdGJywgJ0EnKVxuT05fU01BUlRQSE9ORT1jKCdhbHdheXMnLCAnbmV2ZXInLCAnc29tZXRpbWVzJylcbkZJTkFMRVhBTT1jKDEyLDUsMjApXG5NPWRhdGEuZnJhbWUoU0NPUkUsIEdSQURFLCBPTl9TTUFSVFBIT05FLCBGSU5BTEVYQU0pXG50YWJsZShNJFNDT1JFPjE1LCBNJEdSQURFKVxuI3doYXQgd291bGQgUiBzYXk/In0= 4.7.7 Question eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJ1PC1jKDE6MTApXG53IDwtYygxLC0xLDMpXG51W3c+MF1cbiN3aGF0IHdvdWxkIFIgc2F5PyJ9 4.7.8 Question eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJ2IDwtIGMoLTIsMCwyLC01KVxudlt2PjBdXG4jd2hhdCB3b3VsZCBSIHNheT8ifQ== 4.7.9 Question eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJjKFwiYVwiLDEsVClcbiN3aGF0IHdvdWxkIFIgc2F5PyJ9 4.7.10 Question eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJzYW1wbGUiOiJ4PC0xOjRcbnk8LTI6OVxueCt5XG4jd2hhdCB3b3VsZCBSIHNheT8ifQ== "]]
