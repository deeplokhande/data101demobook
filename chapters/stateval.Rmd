# Simple Statistical Evaluation {#stateval}

The biggest enemy of your findings is randomness. In order to convince your audience that you have found something you need to address the question “how do you know your result is simply sheer luck, it is random?”

This is where you need statistics and simple hypothesis testing. 


#### Some Basics First:

- _Mean_
\begin{equation}
\bar{X}=\frac{\sum{X}}{N}
\ \text{where, X is set of numbers and 
N is size of set.}
\end{equation}

- _Standard Deviation_


## z-test *

A z-test is any statistical test used in hypothesis testing with an underlying normal distribution.
In other words, when the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis can be approximated by a normal distribution, z-test can be used.
Outcome of the z-test is the z-score which is a numerical measure to test the mean of a distribution.
z-score is measured in terms of standard deviation from mean.
